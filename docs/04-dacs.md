# DAC Configuration

While most Raspberry Pi boards come with an onboard sound card, it's well known that the quality you can get from them is not the greatest. The Pi Foundation does an excellent job at keeping the cost of their boards down, but that comes with some compromises with audio being one of them. The [audio circuitry](https://hackaday.com/2018/07/13/behind-the-pin-how-the-raspberry-pi-gets-its-audio/) does an OK job, but it's nothing stellar.

If you want to upgrade the sound quality of your balenaSound devices (or if you are using a board that does not have onboard sound card such as the Raspberry Pi Zero), you'll need to add a DAC board (Digital Audio Converter) to your project.

### Configure your device
To get a DAC board to work with balenaSound, you will need to make a couple of changes to the device configuration in the balenaCloud dashboard:

* Disable the on-board audio by editing the existing ```RESIN_HOST_CONFIG_dtparam``` variable to set `”audio=off”`.
* Add an additional custom configuration variable called `BALENA_HOST_CONFIG_dtoverlay`. The value of this will depend on your DAC board (see table below).
* Cycle the power by unplugging your pi.

### dtoverlay Values

These are the DACs that are known to work with balenaSound. If your DAC is not on the list let us know! It's usually very simple to add support for new DACs, feel free to open a [PR](https://github.com/balenalabs/balena-sound/compare/) or [issue](https://github.com/balenalabs/balena-sound/issues/new) on our repository.
